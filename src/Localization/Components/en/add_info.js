      about__text2:"The State Service of the Republic of Uzbekistan for monitoring dangerous geological processes (hereinafter referred to as the State Monitoring Service) is a unique organization that carries out activities to identify and timely warn the population and economic facilities from the development of hazardous exogenous geological processes.",
         about__text3:
            "The history of the service dates back to 1958 with the founding of the Bostanlyk Landslide Party and up to the State Tracking Service in 1994 with separate territorial tracking stations in the foothills and mountainous regions of our republic. To carry out activities, specialists of the tracking service conduct engineering and geological studies using modern topographic and geodetic measuring instruments and materials for remote sensing of the Earth to detect the slightest deformations and the development of landslide processes on sections of roads, railways, in infrastructure facilities, mining facilities and near settlements.",
         about__text4: "Currently",
         about__text5:
            "Today, the State Tracking Service has a centralized management apparatus, specialized departments located in the city of Tashkent and 7 territorial tracking stations operating in accordance with the “Regulations on the State Service of the Republic of Uzbekistan for monitoring hazardous geological processes” (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation) in the foothill and mountainous regions of Tashkent, Akhangaran, Namangan, Fergana, Andijan, Samarkand, Navoi, Jizzakh, Kashkadarya and Surkhandarya regions of the Republic of Uzbekistan.",
         about__text6:
            "The priority task of the State Tracking Service is to carry out its activities in cooperation with state and economic administration bodies, local state authorities and other organizations for the purpose.",
         about__text7:
            "The activity is mainly regulated by the regulation, internal regulations and regulatory documents. Each territorial tracking station has its own base according to the monitoring region and the head, in the position of the head of the territorial tracking station. Leading specialists, hydrogeological engineers, technical staff and a fleet of vehicles with highly qualified drivers work at the tracking stations. For prompt response to manifestations of dangerous exogenous geological processes, employees of territorial tracking stations are provided with the necessary vehicles and modern instruments for measuring and conducting observational work.",
         about__text8:
            "For the full functioning and operational organization of work in the State Tracking Service, there are specialized departments of geodetic works, geological surveys, cartography and GIS technologies, accompanying specialists from territorial tracking stations to improve the quality and information content of the work being carried out. Also, it should be noted that the scientific part of engineering and geological surveys is an integral part of the work of the State Tracking Service, which regularly holds seminars, briefings and conferences to improve the knowledge of employees and raise public awareness about the ongoing work and activities of the service. Research objects",
         about__text9:
            "Research objects of the State Tracking Service has a wide range of industries and the main direction is engineering and geological research to assess landslide hazard",

         about__text13:
            "Currently, the State Tracking Service is actively modernizing the material and technical base and is taking a number of measures to increase the level of knowledge of employees in international languages, specialized areas, and mainly by studying the experience of leading organizations of a similar profile in other countries of the world. The main goal and position of the service is to achieve full optimization and automation of monitoring, forecasting and information transfer processes with minimal human factor impact during the service. This will significantly improve the efficiency of ongoing work and minimize both social and economic damage from the manifestation of dangerous exogenous geological processes in the territory of the republic.",
         about__text14:
            "In this area, the State Surveillance Service actively carries out joint research and practical work with international cooperation organizations, companies and other research institutions.",
